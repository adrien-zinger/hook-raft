timeout_min = 500
timeout_max = 800
# Min and max value in milisecond of the election timeout. Timeout is randomly choosen between these two values

prepare_term_period = 500
# Value in milisecond that separe term preparations, default 80
# If this time is too short to finish the term preparation, an empty heartbeat
# will be send and the content will be used for the next term. The hook doesn't
# implement any problem management if you fail multiple times to send a term.
# You can manage it yourself with the `send-term` script
